## How to use this module

To use this module, we need to obtain the API key from MistralAI. Follow these steps:

- First, create a Mistral account or log in at [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai/home).

- Then, navigate to "Workspace" and "Billing" to add your payment information and activate payments on your account.
- After that, go to the "API keys" page and create a new API key by clicking on "Create new key". Make sure to copy the API key, store it securely, and not share it with anyone.
